## Purpose
My medical passport aims to be the goto solution for keeping medical records. It helps you track doctor appointments, prescriptions, and even provides a quick way to export medical info. With the aid of this app there will be clearer communication between doctors and patients. This is possible because the records are available from two ends at all times. It will reduce the hassle of generating medical reports and will promote tansparency in healthcare. 

## Information
My medical passport is not your usual app. Its simplicity is thanks to bravo, which made it possible for me to code minimally, besides my potato pc cannot handle android studio... Bravo combined with figma was used to make my app, while i used apis to make the ui functional. I used airtable as my database to store user info and help with other requests.

## Benefits & ways to improve
My medical passport is simple and easy to use. The UI is very modern and is user-friendly, thus allowing people of all ages to use it. This app can be take further with the quick export function which may be used to develop data that can be written into RFID wrist bands, thus allowing healthcare providers and paramedics easy access to patient info such as allergies, blood type, biological sex(to respect privacy), and any other health info.

## Overall Experience 
This was a fun project to make for GIT INIT 2023. It really improved my design skills, and deepened my knowledge of apis. Bravo was not my first option, but along the way I experimented with python guis such as customtkinter, and tkdesigner which sadly i could not make use of in time. It was overall a great learning experience.
